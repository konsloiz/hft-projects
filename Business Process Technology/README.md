### Final Knowledge and Skills:

**Knowledge and understanding**

On completion the student knows how to model inter- and intra-organizational business processes and technical workflows. He or she understands the concepts of orchestration of services and the choreography between services. He or she knows the necessary concepts and technologies for service-enabling existing legacy appli-cations.

**Disciplinary / professional skills**

On completion the student is able to select and use modeling tech-niques for business processes and technical workflows and apply these techniques in a practical project. He or she can rate the techno-logical and organizational implications when an IT landscape in a company has to be transformed into a process-oriented SOA.
