## Module: Containers

* What are containers and how do they work
* Containers vs. VMs 
* History of containers and rise of Docker
* Docker concepts: daemon, hub, dockerfile, CLI
* Multi-container handling with docker-compose
* Limitations and problems with containers
* Multiple container build options (Dockerfile, Buildpacks/Paketo/Jib)

### Objectives and exercises
_The student understands the concepts and use cases of container technology and is able to describe them. The first exercise is to pull sample images from an image registry (e.g. Docker Hub) and interact with them (run, expose port, execute shell, cleanup etc). After that the student can show how to build a custom image via Dockerfile and push it to a registry for others to access. Take the sample application from module "Spring Boot Intro", put it into a container image and run it using a container build mechanism of your choice._
