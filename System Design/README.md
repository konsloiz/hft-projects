### Final Knowledge and Skills:  

**Knowledge and understanding**

On completion the student knows the different interrelationships be- tween requirements and design and architectural choices of large- scale systems. He or she knows the principles of software design and the different design views and knows how a system design affects the testability of a system.

**Disciplinary / professional skills**

On completion the student is able to develop different design views and select fitting patterns for certain problems and draw from archi- tectural choices, especially for large-scale systems. He or she is able to select and use appropriate modeling techniques. He or she can rate the consequences of certain design decisions

### Index
